# Prisma Migrations

## Workflow

- Always use `prisma migrate dev --name <name>` to create a migration — never write migration files manually from scratch or apply SQL directly to the DB
- After generating a migration, you can (and should) edit the SQL manually if needed (e.g. add `IF EXISTS`, data backfills, custom indexes)
- Use `prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration-name>` only when a migration was applied to the DB outside of Prisma (fixes `_prisma_migrations` discrepancy without re-running SQL)

## Key behaviors

- `migrate dev` creates a migration AND applies it; it also regenerates the Prisma client
- `migrate deploy` (used in CI/prod) only applies pending migrations — it does NOT detect drift or generate new ones
- Removing a model from `schema.prisma` does NOT auto-generate a drop migration — you must run `migrate dev` to generate the `DROP TABLE` SQL, then edit it with `IF EXISTS` for safety before applying
- `db push` skips the migration history entirely — never use it in environments where you care about migration history
